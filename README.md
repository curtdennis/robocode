## Synopsis

Robocode is a platform for creating code-driven battlebots.  Your mission is to create an artifically intelligent robot bent on destruction.  After designing your robot to fight against robot enemies, you will then face off against each other in what will certainly be a battle where only one will survive.  

While there are MANY strategies you can employ to confuse or dispose of the competition, you have to decide if brains or brawn will win the day.
